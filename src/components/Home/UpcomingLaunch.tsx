                  Europa is the smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting
                  Jupiter, and the sixth-closest to the planet of all the 80
                  known moons of Jupiter. It is also the sixth-largest moon in
                  the Solar System. Europa was named after Europa, the
                  Phoenician mother of King Minos of Crete and lover of Zeus.

                  Slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, Europa is primarily made
                  of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust and probably an
                  ironâ€“nickel core. It has a very thin atmosphere, composed
                  primarily of oxygen. Its white-beige surface is striated by
                  light tan cracks and streaks, but craters are relatively few.

                  Europa has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in
                  the Solar System. The apparent youth and smoothness of the
                  surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists
                  beneath the surface, which could conceivably harbor
                  extraterrestrial life.
